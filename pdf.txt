The Lexus ATP Head2Head Singles Semi-Finals between Cristian Garin (CHI) and [2] Hubert Hurkacz (POL) will take place at Estadio Millennium. This will be their first meeting at the tour level, although they have faced each other before at the 2018 Wimbledon qualifying matches where Garin emerged victorious with a score of 6-2 6-2 7-5.

Hubert Hurkacz, aged 27, is currently ranked World No. 10 and has reached a career-high of No. 8 in January 2024. He is considered the top Polish men's player in history and has participated in the Nitto ATP Finals in 2021 and 2023. Notably, he achieved his first Grand Slam Semi-Finals at the 2021 Wimbledon by defeating 8-time champion Federer in the final singles match of Federer's career. He also won the 2021 ATP Masters 1000 Miami title by defeating 5 seeds, and he saved a championship point to win the 2023 ATP Masters 1000 Shanghai after losing in the final of the 2022 ATP Masters 1000 Montreal. Additionally, he has reached the Semi-Finals of ATP Masters 1000 tournaments at 2021 Paris, 2022 Miami, and 2023 Cincinnati.

In 2022, he defeated No. 1 Medvedev to win his fifth ATP Tour singles title at the 2022 Halle.

It is worth noting that previously, Hurkacz had reached his first ever ATP Tour Semi-Finals on clay and is now aiming to reach his 10th ATP Tour final, which would be his first since the 2023 Basel. He has a strong record against players ranked outside the Top 100, with a win-loss ratio of 50-12. His most recent loss to a player outside the Top 100 was against No. 123 Draper at the 2023 US Open.

Cristian Garin, aged 27, is currently ranked World No. 112 and has reached a career-high of No. 17 in his career. He achieved his biggest title at the 2020 Rio de Janeiro, which helped him rise to No. 18 in the rankings. He ended the 2021 season at his career-high ranking of No. 17. He is a five-time ATP Tour champion and has notably saved match points against Chardy en route to winning the 2019 Houston title and against No. 3 A. Zverev en route to winning the 2019 Munich title. He reached his first Grand Slam Quarter-Finals at the 2022 Wimbledon and has also reached the Quarter-Finals of ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, including 2019 Paris, 2021 Madrid, and 2022 Rome. His journey in the ATP Tour started when he won his first tour-level match at the 2013 Vina del Mar as a 16-year-old wild card. He then earned his second tour-level win at the 2019 Buenos Aires. As a junior player, he won the 2013 Roland Garros boys' singles title by defeating A. Zverev and reached the boys' doubles final with his countryman Jarry.

Garin aims to reach his 7th ATP Tour final, all of which have been on clay. His last final was at the 2021 Santiago, where he emerged as the champion. He is hoping to become the lowest-ranked finalist in tournament history. He has a record of 3-19 against Top 10 players, with victories over No. 3 Zverev at 2019 Munich, No. 3 Medvedev at 2021 ATP Masters 1000 Madrid, and No. 4 Ruud at 2023 ATP Masters 1000 Indian Wells.

Their previous encounters took place at 2019 Sao Paolo, 2019 Houston, 2022 ATP Cup, 2023 ATP Masters 1000 Indian Wells, and 2023 Hamburg.
