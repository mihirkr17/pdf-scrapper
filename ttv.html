                     <p>LEXUS ATP HEAD2HEAD: SINGLES SEMI-FINALS 

The singles semi-finals at Court Rainier III will feature players [12] Stefanos Tsitsipas and [2] Jannik Sinner. Tsitsipas currently leads in their head-to-head with a score of 5-3. They have faced each other in several previous matches, including ATP Masters 1000 Rome, Barcelona, Australian Open, Rotterdam, and Nitto ATP Finals.

Insights from their previous meeting at the 2023 Nitto ATP Finals show that Sinner had a dominant performance. He had a higher conversion score, steal score, serve quality, return quality, forehand quality, and backhand quality compared to Tsitsipas. Tsitsipas will need to improve his conversion score if he wants to have a chance of beating Sinner.

Stefanos Tsitsipas is 25 years old and currently ranked world No. 12. He achieved a career-high ranking of No. 3 in August 2021. He has 10 wins against top-3 opponents, including 2 wins against No. 1, 3 wins against No. 2, and 5 wins against No. 3 players. Tsitsipas is a six-time Grand Slam semi-finalist, with notable runs at Roland Garros and the Australian Open. He won the 2018 Next Gen ATP Finals and the 2019 Nitto ATP Finals, becoming the youngest champion of the latter since Hewitt in 2001. Tsitsipas has won 10 ATP Tour titles, including consecutive ATP Masters 1000 Monte Carlo titles in 2021 and 2022.

Jannik Sinner is 22 years old and currently ranked world No. 2, which is his career-high ranking. He started 2018 unranked but ended 2020 as the No. 1 teenager. He broke into the top 10 at age 20 in 2021 and reached a career-high of No. 2 in April 2024, becoming the highest-ranked Italian in ATP Rankings history. Sinner has had a successful 2024 season so far, with a record of 25-1 and 3 titles. At the 2024 Australian Open, he defeated Djokovic in the semi-finals and came back from two sets down to win the final against Medvedev, securing his first Grand Slam title. He also became the first Italian champion in Australian Open history. Sinner earned a career-best 64 wins in 2023 and won his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto. He has a 9-match winning streak after winning the ATP Masters 1000 title in Miami.

It will be an exciting match between Tsitsipas and Sinner in the singles semi-finals. Tsitsipas will be looking for his first top-3 win and ATP Masters 1000 final since 2022. Sinner, on the other hand, is aiming to reach his fifth ATP Masters 1000 final and become the third Italian to reach the Monte-Carlo final in the Open Era.</p>
