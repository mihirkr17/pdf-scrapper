ROLEX MONTE-CARLO MASTERS TALKING POINTS  
 
• World No. 1 Novak Djokovic returns to the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters semi-finals for the first time since 
winning the 2015 title. The Serb, who on Sunday became the oldest No. 1 in PIF ATP Rankings history, did 
not lose a set en route to his 77th ATP Masters 1000 SF, setting a new record for most semi-finals in series 
history.  
 
• Djokovic now meets World No. 8 Casper Ruud in their sixth meeting, with the 36-year-old winning all five 
previous matches in straight sets, including 2023 Roland Garros final. He is 257-113 vs. Top 10 players, the 
record for most Top 10 wins in PIF ATP Rankings history and seeks 1st Top 10 win since defeating No. 4 
Jannik Sinner to win 2023 Nitto ATP Finals to reach an ATP Tour final for 19th consecutive season.

* active streaks 
 
• Casper Ruud will attempt to post the biggest win of his career (0-11 vs. Top 3) to reach his 1st clay court 
ATP Masters 1000 final. The Norwegian leads the tour in clay court wins (97), finals (13) and titles (9) since 
the start of 2020 season and aims to break Djokovic’s 10-match winning streak on clay. He would be the 
second consecutive Scandinavian in Monte-Carlo final after Dane Holger Rune played in last year’s final. 
 
• Jannik Sinner is on a 9-match winning streak and leads the ATP Tour in wins (25) and titles (3) this season. 
He became the only player to reach the semi-finals at all three ATP Masters 1000 events this season and 
now seeks his 5th ATP Masters 1000 final, first on clay, against No. 12 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in their ninth 
meeting. Sinner is on a 26-match winning streak vs. players ranked outside the Top 10.

Andy Murray  2009    
Roger Federer  2006  BOLD: Won all three ATP Masters 1000 titles in that year 
 
• Two-time champion Stefanos Tsitsipas takes a 5-3 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his SF vs. Sinner. He 
seeks his 3rd clay court win over a Top-2 player (2-9), first since defeating No. 2 Medvedev at 2021 Roland 
Garros and his 1st ATP Masters 1000 final since 2022 Cincinnati, 1st on clay since 2022 Rome. This 
weekend, the Greek could join Rafael Nadal (11), Bjorn Borg (3), Thomas Muster (3) and Ilie Nastase (3) 
as the only players with 3+ Monte-Carlo titles in Open Era.
