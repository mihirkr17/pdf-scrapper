Munar's first ATP Tour final came in 2021 at Marbella, where he defeated his countryman Alcaraz but ultimately lost to countryman Carreno Busta. He has notable victories against top-10 players, defeating No. 3 Zverev at the 2019 Marrakech and No. 3 Ruud at the 2022 Tokyo. His Challenger record stands at 128-68, with a recent clay-court title at the 2023 San Marino tournament.
